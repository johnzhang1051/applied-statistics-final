# Project Overview

Hello!

This repository contains a research project analyzing the factors affecting individual income per capita across U.S. states from 2015 to 2017. The study employs linear regression models to identify key variables influencing income levels.

You can access the full paper [here](https://github.com/johnzhang1051/applied-statistics-final/blob/main/Applied%20Stats%20Final.pdf).

I've included the original R code and cleaned .csv data files as well. The code is a bit messy, as this was written in 2018 when I was still learning how to code well.
